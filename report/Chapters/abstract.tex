\chapter{Introduction}
This report contains my work from the programming class bootcamp. The report is split up into 7 chapters, with the first chapter (this one) being a short introduction and each of the following chapters is about 1 day of the bootcamp. These chapters are split up into a section with a summary of the topics of that day and a section that explains what the assignment was, what I tried to achieve and how you applied the topics from the ``listen'' segment. The final chapter is a reflection on the bootcamp as a whole. The .zip file that contains this report also contains the source code for each of the 5 assignments.

    I am fully aware that no links are allowed and the .zip file is intended to stand on its own, but in case it is easier, the full contents are also available on GitHub through the following link:
