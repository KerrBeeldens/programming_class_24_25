This repository contains the source code for the assignments I created during the "Programming Class" bootcamp and accompanying report. 
It contains the following folders:

- The source code of the 5 assignments, separated into folders:
    - assignment 1: Half-tone
    - assignment 2: Growth
    - assignment 3: Give Me Space
    - assignment 4: Etch-a-sketch
    - assignment 5: Tetris
- The source code of the accompanying report (LaTeX). **N.B.** This document will not compile as it requires a custom LaTeX package and document class.
- The compiled report (PDF).
